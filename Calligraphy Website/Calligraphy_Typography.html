<h1>History of The English Language</h1>     <p>The 2nd Millennium BC Spanned the Years 2000 BC to 1001 BC. In the Ancient Near East, it marks the transition from the Middle to the Late Bronze Age.</p></div>

<p>During the <strong>2nd millennium BCE</strong>,various Semitic peoples at the eastern end of the Mediterranean were <em>experimenting with alphabetic writing.</em> Between 1500 and 1000 BCE, alphabetic signs found in scattered sites showed a correspondence of form and provided material for sound translations. Bodies of writing from this period are fragmented: a few signs scratched on sherds or cut in stone. Few of these are celebrated in terms of aesthetic value. </p> 
 <h3>Much of the Archaeological Digs have Found Scrolls Dating Back Thousands of Years.</h3>   
<p>One interesting set of Semitic inscriptions was discovered in 1905 at an ancient mining site on the <strong>Sinai Peninsula.</strong> A sphinx from that discovery yields the taw, nun, taw, or t, n, t, meaning “gift.” It is evident that the nun, or n, <em><mark>sign is a rendering of a serpent.</mark></em> Most of the early Semitic alphabetic signs were similarly derived from word signs of more ancient vintage.</p>

<h3>The Evolution of Language in the Written Character Form</h3>
<p>The several Semitic peoples in the <em>Middle East area spoke languages</em> that were closely related, and this enabled them to use the same set of alphabetic signs. After some experimentation the alphabet was reduced to <strong>22 signs for consonants.</strong> There were no vowel signs. The tribes of Canaan (Hebrews, Phoenicians, and Aramaeans) were important in the development of alphabetic writing, and all seemed to be employing the alphabet by 1000 BCE.</p>
<h3>The World of Ancient Europa Scrit Writing</h3>
<p>The Phoenicians, living along a 20-mile (30-kilometre) strip on the Mediterranean, made the great sea their second home, giving the alphabet to Greeks in the mutual trading area and leaving inscriptions in many sites. One of the <em>finest Phoenician inscriptions</em> exists on a bronze cup from Cyprus called the <strong>Baal of Lebanon</strong> (in the Louvre, Paris) dating from about 800 BCE. The so-called Moabite Stone (also in the Louvre), which dates from about 850 BCE, has an inscription that is also a famous example of early Semitic writing.</p>

<h3>Orgins of Old English Calligraphy</h3> 
<p>The history of the English language really started with the arrival of three Germanic tribes who invaded Britain during the 5th century AD. These tribes, the Angles, the Saxons and the Jutes, <em><mark>crossed the North Sea from what today is Denmark</mark></em> and northern Germany. At that time the inhabitants of Britain spoke a <strong>Celtic language.</strong> But most of the Celtic speakers were pushed west and north by the invaders - mainly into what is now Wales, Scotland and Ireland. The Angles came from "Englaland" [sic] and their language was called "Englisc" - from which the words "England" and "English" are derived.The invading <strong>Germanic tribes</strong> spoke similar languages, which in Britain developed into what we now call Old English. <em><mark>Old English did not sound or look like English today.</mark></em> Native English speakers now would have great difficulty understanding Old English. Nevertheless, about half of the most commonly used words in Modern English have Old English roots. The words be, strong and water, for example, derive from Old English. Old English was spoken until around 1100 CE.</p></div>
