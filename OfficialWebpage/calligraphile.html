 <h2>Artisan Community</h2>
<p>Craftsmanship is about how we can come together as a community of creative people to build a network of calligraphers that inspire others in different ways. 

Simply put, The Craftsmanship Initiative promotes handcrafts and innovation that make the world a better place.To demonstrate what craftsmanship means to Calligrahile's own creative community we have a small historical biography of where the most used utensil comes from.</p><h2><a href="https://craftsmanship.net/field-notes/why-nothing-writes-like-a-fountain-pen/">A Story of the Fountain Pen - Craftsmanship Magazine</a></h2>

<h2>Calligraphy Master</h2>
<p>We really have to start with the question of what is a fountain pen? It seems simple enough - we all know they're those pens with nibs, usually metal nibs. But if we go back to when the fountain pen was developed, that's not what the term meant. Back then, a fountain pen was a pen that had the ink inside it - anything that wasn't a dip pen. At that time, a Bic Cristal would have been considered a fountain pen. As new types of pen came along, new terms were needed.

Other terms have changed their meanings over the years too. At one point, a 'pen' was what we would now refer to as the nib. The rest of the pen was the 'pen holder'. But with fountain pens being all in once piece, that terminology started to change. The word 'nib' did exist back then, but it referred to the very tip part of what we'd now call a nib.</p>
    
<p>Compared to the main option at the time, carrying around a quill and a bottle of ink, the need for a fountain pen was fairly obvious to most. But developing a tube full of ink with an opening at the bottom where the ink didn't fall out except in very limited amounts onto paper, was not so easy. It's thought that Leonardo da Vinci may well have made one for his own use, way back around 1500, but it was well into the 1800s before they started to become reliable and commonly used.
    
They were still considered quite prone to leaking until some innovation started to happen with the design of the feed, around 1900. I believe most calligrapher enthusiasts still use quills, but for fancy invitations and special occassions.</p>
    
<p>The Pen Maker, Masuyama got his start decades ago at Sailor, a top-notch Japanese pen and ink manufacturer that makes one of my favorite pens. (The company got its name from its start, in 1911, when a British sailor in Hiroshima met a Japanese engineer and gave him a fountain pen.) My Sailor was made with what the company calls its “music” nib, because the two tines that form its nib are wide but sharp. While a true music nib contains three tines, even this pen, when manipulated by a skilled writer, will easily form those little flags that turn into music (quarter notes, halves, full notes, etc.).</p></div>
